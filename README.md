# Character-Recognition-From-Image
Character recognition from image descriptions involves converting textual descriptions of characters within an image into machine-readable format. This process usually entails using computer vision techniques coupled with natural language processing (NLP). Here's a basic outline of how this could be done:

Image Description Extraction: Extract textual descriptions of the image content. This could be done through various means, such as manual annotation, crowdsourcing, or automated image captioning using deep learning models like CNN-RNN architectures.

Preprocessing: Preprocess the extracted descriptions to remove noise, standardize formats, and tokenize the text into words or phrases.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Apply NER techniques to identify and extract entities mentioned in the descriptions. In this case, the entities of interest would be the characters within the image.

Character Recognition: Use the identified character names to search for corresponding images or references, or link them to databases where information about these characters is stored. This could involve leveraging existing databases or APIs specific to character data.

Verification and Correction: Validate the recognized characters against known databases or validate through human verification to ensure accuracy. This step may involve resolving ambiguities or errors in recognition.

Integration and Application: Integrate the recognized character information into the desired application or system. This could be used in various contexts, such as indexing images, generating metadata, or enabling search functionalities based on character descriptions.

Feedback Loop (Optional): Implement a feedback loop mechanism where the system learns from corrections or feedback provided by users to continually improve its character recognition accuracy.

This process combines techniques from computer vision, NLP, and information retrieval to convert textual descriptions of characters in images into actionable data. Depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the application, the approach and techniques used may vary.

# Step 1: 
Building the Classifier: Training a CNN to recognize digits (0-9) and uppercase letters (A-Z) is a solid foundation. CNNs are commonly used for image classification tasks and should work well for recognizing individual characters.

# Step 2: 
Character Segmentation: This step is crucial for accurately identifying individual characters within a handwritten word. Make sure the segmentation algorithm can handle variations in handwriting styles and spacing between characters effectively.

# Step 3: 
Classification of Segmented Characters: Once characters are segmented, passing them through the trained CNN classifier should yield the recognition results. Ensure that the classifier is robust and can generalize well to different handwriting styles.

# Recognition and Post-Processing:

Sorting contours to get the correct order of individual characters is a smart approach, especially for handwritten text where characters may not be perfectly aligned.
The "get letters" function to fetch the list of letters and the "get word" function to reconstruct the word from the recognized letters seem appropriate for assembling the final output.
Left-to-right sorting for extracting a single word is logical and aligns with the typical reading direction.

# Conclusion:

It's good to acknowledge the limitations of the model due to training on a slightly smaller dataset. Training on a larger and more diverse dataset can certainly improve the model's performance.
Your suggestion for handling complete paragraphs (line segmentation >> word segmentation >> character segmentation >> classification >> post-processing) is a systematic approach that can scale to larger text recognition tasks.
